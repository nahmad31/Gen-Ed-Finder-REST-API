# Gen Ed Finder REST API
This is the REST API created using Python and Flask that helps run the Gen Ed Finder android app.Â The app sends a post request to the API containing a class at UIUC as it's body. 
Then the API finds similar courses to the one imputed using scikit-learn and then returns the results to the app.
